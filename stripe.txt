STRIPE CODE

How Stripe works:
  - When user enters CC info & hits submit, JavaScript pauses the submit so that the 
    CC info is not saved onto our database, preventing legal complications.
    
  - JavaScript code will then extract the CC info from the form & send it to the Stripe
    servers, where Stripe will process the card info & send back to us a unique 'Card Token' (one-time use).
    
  - The form submission to our own servers will then resume, where the user's personal particulars 
    (username, password etc.) are then validated on our servers (e.g. Devise will check
    that the email contains the '@' char, password is at least 6 chars, etc.)
    
  - If the validations are cleared, our servers will then take the user's info,
    along with the plan ID & Card Token, and send it back to the Stripe servers again, 
    where Stripe will then take the info and log in a new subscription on their
    databases, which we can see from the Stripe dashboard. The Stripe servers will
    then send us back a unique 'Customer Token' (recurring use), which we can then finally save on 
    our own servers, along with the user's data (user, pass etc.).
  - This is also the step in which Stripe will process the charge on the user's card.
  - To save the Customer Token to our DB, we should also create a new column in the Users table.
